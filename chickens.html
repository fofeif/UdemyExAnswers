      The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl
      species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon
      junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock
      is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a
      cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird
      is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet./p>
    </p>
    <p>
      Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens
      were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries
      BC).[2][3] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food
      (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Biddy: a newly hatched chicken[13][14]</li>
      <li>Capon: a castrated or neutered male chicken[a]</li>
      <li>Chook /tʃʊk/: a chicken (Australia/New Zealand, informal)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>General biology and habitat</h2>
    <p>
      Chickens are omnivores.[28] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to
      search for seeds, insects, and even animals as large as lizards, small
      snakes,[29] or sometimes young mice
    </p>
    <p>
      Domestic chickens are not capable of long-distance flight, although
      lighter chickens are generally capable of flying for short distances, such
      as over fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost). Chickens
      may occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally
      do so only to flee perceived danger.

    <h3>Behavior</h3>
    <h4>Social behaviour</h4>
    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken">Chickens</a> are
      gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal
      approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young. Individual
      chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a 'pecking order',
      with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting
      locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary
      disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established.
      Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to
      fighting and injury.[34]
    </p>
    <h4>Vocalizations</h4>
    <p>
      When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He
      does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping
      the food. This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their
      chicks and encourage them to eat
    </p>
    <p>
      A rooster's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a
      territorial signal to other roosters.[35] However, roosters may also crow
      in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings.
